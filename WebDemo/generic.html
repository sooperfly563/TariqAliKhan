										<h1>Generic</h1>

									<p>As wide and long as my imagination spans, you'll find it hard to believe that I have run out of things to write about here. So, instead of writing the boilerplate <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> we have grown to love so much, I will instead express my love for the Justice League...</p>
									<p>Okay, so first things first; the movie did <b>NOT</b> do them any justice. In fact I would argue the movie was a crime against humanity. The Justice League is a team from DC comics comprised of the best superheroes on the planet. The strongest, fastest, most powerful and resilient beings that protect earth...and Batman. However, what Batman lacks in strength and speed he makes up for in intelligence, strategic thinking, advacned gadgets/technology, and cool karate combat moves...not to mention all the money. Superman is the strongest dude on the planet. Combine that with super speed, and an awesome comb-over you got a dude who everybody can thank God he's a good guy. Wonder Woman is the perfect combination of both Batman and Superman. She's got the awesome strength and speed, <b>and</b> the awesome karate moves that would make Mr. Miyagi proud. Cyborg is the ultimate I.T guy, half-man half-alien-technology he can hack into any computer in the universe. Wanna know what aliens in another Galaxy are talking about right now? Just ask Cyborg to hack their e-mails. Flash is the fastest man on earth. Superman can run faster than a speeding bullet, but <b>The Flash</b> can move so fast he can learn how to knit, then make a sweater, <b>wear</b> the sweater, realize the sweater makes him look fat, throw away the sweater, promise himself he's going to start dieting all before that bullet can move an inch. Fast right? Green Lantern...what can I say about Green Lantern? This guy got a ring that can make anything that he thinks of. Giant Basebal bat? Punching glove? you got it. Last but not least there's Aquaman. This guy swims faster than a jet can fly, he's like the Micheal Phelps of all Micheal Phelps'. He can lift submarines in and out of water, talk to fish about their dating problems, and he's got that cool spear that would make King Neptune jealous. </p>
									<p>Hope reading this was more fun than reading a bunch of Lorem Ipsums...</p>
