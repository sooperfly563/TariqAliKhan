									<p>Below you will find a plethora of 'Lorem Ipsum' type dialogues. I don't know what it means, in fact I once put it into Google Translate and it turns out Lorem Ipsum is Latin for <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> in English. You can imagine just about any type of writing in it's place and nothing will change. In fact you can change the writing yourself by going in <b>Developer Options</b> in your browser and put just about anything you want here. Go on try it! It's fun right? Sometimes I do that for articles I find online just so I can win arguements against my sister. One time I convinced her that there are more Crocodiles in Australia than there are humans...was it the right thing to do? Probably not, but you should've seen her face! Anyways hope you enjoy all the Lorems and the Ipsums!</p>

											<p>I'm sure hundreds if not thousands of Web demos have Lorem Ipsum all over the page. If you're like me you've probably seen the text so much to the point where Lorem Ipsum is more recognizable to you than your own name. So instead, below I will actually present a small history of our good friend Lorem.</p>

												<h3>What (or Who) is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

												<h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This one was actually surprising to me, because for years I've thought it was just random text. However, it's not! It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over <b>2000 years old</b>. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.</p>

										<h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
									</header>
									<p>It's possible the reason why so many developers use Lorem Ipsum is because it's become part of the norm. Others believe that Lorem Ipsum is placed in dummy text because normal text can be distracting to those who are visiting the site to view it's layout. Personally I beleive it's used because it makes us look cool, as if we have our own secret language that can nobody can decipher. Regardless of <b>Why</b> we use it, Lorem Ipsum has become a normality to us, and I will name my first born Lorem Ipsum so that he or she can grow up, and go into programming thinking it's proper practice for Developers to write their own name all over projects they are making.</p>
